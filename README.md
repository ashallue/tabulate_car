# tabulate_car
Tabulate Carmichael numbers.  Improvement over Pinch is in the case of small pre-products.  Authors: Andrew Shallue and Jonathan Webster.

Note that the branches got confused and I never bothered reconciling them; the work you want is the master branch, not the main branch.

If you got to this repository from one of our first papers, know that the large case work is fully deprecated.  See https://github.com/ashallue/CarmichaelAlgorithms for a faster codebase and cleaner algorithmic approach.
